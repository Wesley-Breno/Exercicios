<h1>Todo list with FastAPI</h1>

Simple design of an API using the FastAPI framework.

The project consists of an API that contains user authentication to create a task list.
Each user has their own task list and can CRUD it. Users with administrator permissions,
are able to see all the task lists of all users and can also exclude a specific task by informing
your ID.

This project was only done with the aim of consolidating my practical knowledge in FastAPI, so that it will soon be increased
the complexity of the design for use in real production.
